# RBAC-BT

RBAC Policy-Based Testing (RBAC-BT) is a tool for Model-Based Testing RBAC policy testing using Finite State Machines (FSM).

It has been developed in the context of the M.Sc. degree project of Carlos Damasceno using the Java programming language.

It supports the conversion of RBAC policies to FSMs, generation of test sequences from RBAC policies described as FSM models, RBAC test prioritization, and test execution.
