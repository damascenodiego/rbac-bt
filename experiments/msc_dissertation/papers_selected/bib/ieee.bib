abstract={Obligations are mandatory actions that users must perform, addressing access control requirements. To ensure that such obligations are implemented correctly, an automated and systematic testing approach is often recommended. One such approach is Model-Based Testing (MBT) that allows defining cost-effective testing strategies to support rigorous testing via automation. In this paper, we present MBT for obligations by extending the Unified Modeling Language (UML) via a profile called the Obligations Profile. Based on the profile, we define a modeling methodology utilizing the concepts of Obligations Class Diagrams (OCDs) and Obligations State Machines (OSMs), which are standard UML Class Diagrams and UML State Machines with stereotypes from the Obligations Profile. Our methodology, using OCDs and OSMs, is automatically enforced by the validation of constraints defined in the profile. To assess the completeness and applicability of the profile and methodology, we modeled 47 obligations from four different systems. The results of our case study show that we successfully modeled all the obligations and used 75% of the stereotypes that we defined in the profile. In addition, using OCDs and OSMs, we automatically generate executable test cases using a standard state machine structural coverage criterion and common test data generation strategies. The effectiveness of generated test cases is assessed using mutation analysis on two systems, using mutation operators specifically designed for obligation faults. Test case execution killed 75% of the mutants and a careful analysis further suggests that more sophisticated testing strategies must be defined to further improve testing effectiveness.},

abstract={We propose an approach for conformance testing of implementations required to enforce access control policies specified using the Temporal Role-Based Access Control (TRBAC) model.

The TIOA model is transformed to a deterministic se-FSA model that captures any temporal constraint by using two special events Set and Exp. The modified W-method and integer-programming-based approach are used to construct a conformance test suite from the transformed model. The conformance test suite so generated provides complete fault coverage with respect to the proposed fault model for TRBAC specifications.},

pages={680-683}, 
abstract={Access control model is widely used in access control politics testing, it usually consists of three hierarchy fields: roles, permissions and contexts. But the relations information between the three fields is not taken into consideration intact when building the access control models. Because of the information is leaking, engineers has to use random testing or pair wise testing when using access control model, they has to exchange test coverage for test efficiency. Some researchers extended the original access control model with rules, priority and status in order to complementary the missing information, but due to the structure disadvantage of original access control model, few works showed promising result. This paper presents a method using labeled transition system model in formalizing software access control politics though several examples, the method can formalize key information like rules, priority and status along with roles, permissions and contexts into model. This paper also briefly introduces how to use labeled transition system model in security test cases automatic generating.},

abstract={The interaction between business communities becomes a crucial requirement due to the need of exchanging and sharing resources and services. In general, each system defines its own security policy to manage access control to its resources. In this case, we may have security interoperability problems due to the variety and complexity of secured systems implementations. In this paper, we provide a formal approach for interoperability testing of security rules. First we propose a method to integrate interoperability security rules in a functional model represented by an extended finite automata. Then, test cases are generated from the obtained secured functional model by using an automatic test generation tool, Test Gen-IF. As an application, we provide a case study of security interoperability between two hospitals that share some resources.},

abstract={The verification of Spatio-Temporal Role Based Access Control policies (STRBAC) during the early development life cycle improves the security of the software. It helps to identify inconsistencies in the Access Control policies before proceeding to other phases where the cost of fixing defects is augmented. This paper proposes a formal method for an automatic analysis of STRBAC policies. It ensures that the policies are consistent and conflict-free. The method proposed in this paper makes the use of Timed Automata to verify the STRBAC policies. This is done by translating the STRBAC model into Timed Automata, and then the produced Timed Automata is implemented and verified using the model checker UPPAAL. This paper presents a security query expressed using TCTL to detect inconsistency caused due to the interaction between STRBAC policies. With the help of an example, this paper shows how we convert STRBAC model to Timed Automata models and verify the resulting models using the UPPAAL to identify an erroneous design.},

abstract={In the security domain, access control (AC) consists in specifying who can access to what and how, with the four well-known concepts of permission, prohibition, obligation and separation of duty. In this paper, we focus on role-based access control (RBAC) models and more precisely on the verification of formal RBAC models. We propose a solution for this verification issue, based on the use of the Tamago platform. In Tamago, functional contracts can be defined with pre/post conditions and deterministic automata. The Tamago platform provides tools for static verifications of these contracts, generation of test scenarios from the abstract contracts and monitoring facilities for dynamic analyses. We have extended the platform to take into account AC aspects. AC rules, expressed in a subset of EB3SEC, a process algebra-based language, are translated into pre and post conditions of new security contracts. We have also adapted the test case generator to derive suitable test scenarios and the monitoring framework by adding a new security component.},

abstract={Conformance testing procedures for generating tests from the finite state model representation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies are proposed and evaluated. A test suite generated using one of these procedures has excellent fault detection ability but is astronomically large. Two approaches to reduce the size of the generated test suite were investigated. One is based on a set of six heuristics and the other directly generates a test suite from the finite state model using random selection of paths in the policy model. Empirical studies revealed that the second approach to test suite generation, combined with one or more heuristics, is most effective in the detection of both first-order mutation and malicious faults and generates a significantly smaller test suite than the one generated directly from the finite state models.},

abstract={Modern networking technologies, such as Cloud or SOA, enable cooperations and individuals to form dynamic coalitions for temporary sharing of resources and information in order to achieve a common goal. In recent years the need for a formal understanding of the structures, the dynamic aspects and the processes of these coalitions has grown. In my ongoing thesis I propose a formal framework based on the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in order to grasp and characterize dynamic coalitions in general and privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions in particular. The ASM formalism allows for a structural description of dynamic coalitions as well as for a formalization of the inherent processes by means of ASM-runs, thereby enabling simulation, testing, and verification possibilities for the design of supporting architectures. This paper shows how the CoreASM-toolset is used to develop an abstract model of dynamic coalitions and extended to integrate trust-based access control mechanisms in order to enforce privacy aspects in highly dynamic coalitions. Finally an ongoing case study is introduced and first insights to the usability of the proposed model are given.},

The transitions in this model are determined by packet header information, packet location, and policy semantics for the devices being modeled. We encode the semantics of access control policies with Boolean functions using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We then use computation tree logic (CTL) and symbolic model checking to investigate all future and past states of this packet in the network and verify network reachability and security requirements. Thus, our contributions in this work is the global encoding for network configurations that allows for general reachability and security property-based verification using CTL model checking. We have implemented our approach in a tool called ConfigChecker. While evaluating ConfigChecker, we modeled and verified network configurations with thousands of devices and millions of configuration rules, thus demonstrating the scalability of this approach.},

The missions are specified as rich, temporal logic statements about the satisfaction of the properties. The main objective is to be able to synthesize, test, and evaluate control policies for complex aerial missions. Our testbed consists of quadrotors, a motion capture system that provides precise and continuous position information of the quadrotor, projectors that can emulate dynamically changing environments, physical obstacles, and computers that control the quadrotor, the motion capture system, and the projectors. Our computational approach is hierarchical. At the bottom level, we partition the environment and construct an abstraction in the form of a finite transition system such that the quadrotor can execute its transitions by using low level feedback controllers. At the top level, we draw inspiration from LTL model checking and use a value iteration algorithm to determine an optimal control policy that guarantees the satisfaction of the specification under nondeterministically changing properties. We illustrate the approach for the particular case of a surveillance mission in a city-like environment.},

abstract={Web applications are widely used in people's everyday life. They have permeated financial sectors, banking sectors, e-business and online shopping. Usually, different users have different permissions on these applications. Additionally, role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms have been wildly integrated into web applications. The security and correctness of web applications are the most fundamental, crucial aspects to the success of business and organizations. In existing research work on modeling of RBAC, the user's roles and permissions are fixed and static, and do not consider that with the evolution and running of the system, the roles and permissions are dynamic. To the best of our knowledge, research work on role-based access control modeling and testing for web application has been seldom done. In this paper, taking the dynamic feature of roles and permissions into account, we propose an approach to modeling and testing web applications with role-based access control. We give out an algorithm to capture and compute the dynamicity of roles and permissions in running time. The FSM is employed to model the behavior of web applications, and then the augmented FSM (AFSM) is plied as a tool to model role-based access control. Finally, using the construction algorithm, the tests are generated automatically which satisfy the corresponding test coverage criteria.},

Each environment agent is modeled by a Markov chain whereas the robot is modeled by a finite transition system (in the deterministic case) or Markov decision process (in the stochastic case). Existing results in probabilistic verification are adapted to solve the synthesis problem. To partially address the state explosion issue, we propose an incremental approach where only a small subset of environment agents is incorporated in the synthesis procedure initially and more agents are successively added until we hit the constraints on computational resources. Our algorithm runs in an anytime fashion where the probability that the robot satisfies its specification increases as the algorithm progresses.},

abstract={Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most widespread security mechanisms in use today. Given the growing complexity of policy languages and access control systems, verifying that such systems enforce the desired invariants is recognized as a security problem of crucial importance. In the present paper, we develop a framework for the formal verification of grsecurity, an access control system developed on top of Unix/Linux systems. The verification problem in grsecurity presents much of the complexity of modern RBAC systems, due to the presence of policy state changes that may arise both from explicit administrative primitives supported by grsecurity, and as the result of the interaction with the underlying operating system facilities. We develop a formal semantics for grsecurity's RBAC system, based on a labelled transition system, and a sound abstraction of that semantics providing a bounded approximation, amenable to model checking. We report on the result of the experimental analysis conducted with gran, the model checker we implemented based on our abstract semantics, on existing public servers running grsecurity to implement their RBAC systems.},

abstract={Web sites are often a mixture of static sites and programs that integrate relational databases as a back-end. As they evolve to meet ever-changing user needs, new versions of programs, interactions and functionalities may be added and existing ones may be removed or modified. Web sites require configuration and programming attention to assure security, confidentiality, and trust of the published information. During evolution of Web software, from one version to the next one, security properties may change and possible changes may include new flaws or corrections. Changes to security properties, including access control privileges, can be monitored by observing and analyzing changes between security models extracted from different versions of an application. This paper defines Property Satisfaction Profiles (PSP) as the satisfaction values of properties computed on the extracted models. This paper presents also an investigation of the evolution of the changes in the PSP computed on security models of different versions of a Web application. Model extraction and PSP computation can be performed in linear time on one version. Comparison between two versions is also linear and practical performance is fast. This paper reports results about experiments performed on 31 versions of phpBB, that is a publicly available bulletin board written in PHP. Version 1.0.0 (9547 LOC) to version 2.0.22 (40663 LOC) have been considered as a case study. Results show that the proposed approach can be used to observe and monitor the evolution of PSP in successive versions of the same software package. Suggestions for further research are also presented.},

abstract={Trust negotiation is an approach to access control whereby access is granted based on trust established in a negotiation between the service requester and the service provider. Trust negotiation systems avoid several problems facing traditional access control models such as DAC (discretionary access control) and MAC (mandatory access control). Another problem is that Web service providers often do not know requesters identities in advance because of the ubiquitousness of services. We describe Trust-Serv, a trust negotiation framework for Web services, which features a policy language based on state machines. It is supported by lifecycle management and automated runtime enforcement tools. Credential retrieval and validation in Trust-Serv rely on predefined Web services that provide interactions with attribute assertion authorities and public key infrastructure.},

We first use UML state machines to capture the behavior of wireless stations implementing the DCF and we thereafter translate them into the input language of the UPPAAL model checker, that is a network of communicating timed automata.

abstract={A business process can be developed as a composition of Web services provided by different service providers. These service providers may have their own policies and constraints for service provisioning and collaboration. In this paper, we focus on secure composition of services, specifically from the perspective of service enactment. Service enactment requires finding an execution plan for the service composition that conforms to the requirements and constraints of the service requester and all service providers. However, due to privacy and security concerns, participants may selectively expose their Web service operations and process details. We propose an approach for service enactment that does not require the participants to reveal their internal operations and constraints and that can still result in an execution plan which satisfies the requirements and constraints of all participants. The proposed approach uses Finite State Machines (FSM) to model component Web service operations, their interdependencies, as well security and access control policy constraints. Model checking is used to generate an appropriate Web service execution plan in an incremental manner. Commutative encryption based techniques are used to preserve privacy and security.},

abstract={Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is arguably the most common access control mechanism today due to its applicability at various levels of authorization in a system. Time varying nature of access control in RBAC administered systems is often implemented through Temporal-RBAC - an extension of RBAC in the temporal domain. In this paper, we propose an initial approach towards verification of security properties of a Temporal-RBAC system. Each role is mapped to a timed automaton. A controller automaton is used to activate and deactivate various roles.

abstract={A successful approach to problems of protocol specification, implementation, and verification is presented. Protocols are specified in a language called LIFP (Language for Implementing Fast Protocols) which is based on a model of interacting state machines. A compiler translates LIFP specifications into code that can be executed on PNPS (programmable network prototyping system), an experimental network emulator developed at the University of California at Berkeley. Verification of a LIFP control is facilitated by a debugger that simulates both PNPS hardware and the network environment in which the protocol is supposed to operate. This approach is compared with others (SPANNER and ESTELLE). Some aspects of the problem of protocol design allow it to be usefully viewed as one of supervisory control of a discrete event system. However, other aspects of protocol design show that current theories of supervisory control are inadequate.<>},

VFSM has been used in the design of more than 75 software modules, and its application has resulted in shorter development intervals and the elimination of defects prior to testing. In this paper, we present an overview of the VFSM design and implementation paradigms and the capabilities provided by the VFSM toolset.

In order to utilize the information corresponding to multiple input templates in a most efficient way, we propose a minutiae-based matching state model which uses relationship between test templates and enrolled template. The principle of this algorithm is that matching parameters, i.e the sets of matched minutiae, between these templates should be consistent in genuine matchings. Experiments are performed on FVC2002 fingerprint databases. Result shows that the system utilizing the proposed matching state model is able to outperform the original system with raw matching scores.

abstract={Recently, most enterprises adapt Web services technologies for designing and building complex inter-enterprise business applications. These applications are built by the coordination between set of Web services. Therefore, checking the compatibility between two services to guarantee that they can interact correctly is an important issue. In case of service update or replacement, there is a need for checking the replaceability to ensure that the new service is compatible with all the services which were compatible with the replaced one. These two type of checking are based on the services descriptions. Enriching services descriptions by including their behaviours is becoming more and more important. This behaviour can be described by business protocols representing the possible sequences of message exchanges. Since a lot of Web services use access control policies to restrict the access to authorized consumers, these policies should be a part of the service description. Checking compatibility and replaceability between Web services by analyzing their business protocols after assigning the access control policies is the main contribution of this work. Access control policies will be presented using ontology.},

To work around this problem, we identify state transition of the protocol that can be used to simplify the models and make verification feasible. This paper explains the state transition model of two way handshake mechanism of IEEE 802.11 standard for MAC DCF. Using these observations, a time variant generalized state transition model for channel, sender and destination station has been described.

They involve the design and the modeling of various system aspects expressed usually through different paradigms. In this paper, we propose to combine two modeling formalisms in order to express both functional and security timed requirements of a system. First, the system behavior is specified based on its functional requirements using TEFSM (timed extended finite state machine) formalism. Second, this model is augmented by applying a set of dedicated algorithms to integrate timed security requirements specified in Nomad language. This language is well adapted to express security properties such as permissions, prohibitions and obligations with time considerations. The resulting secure model can be used for several purposes such as code generation, specification correctness proof, model checking or automatic test generation.

Finally, the new fuzzed inputs are generated by resolving the constraints resulting from the EPBFSM.

abstract={An adaptive medium access control (MAC) protocol for broadcast networks is introduced, which can operate efficiently under highly bursty traffic conditions and can handle stations transmitting packets of arbitrary length. The proposed Variable Packet Length Adaptive Protocol (VPLAP) belongs to the family of learning-automata-based protocols, which resolves most drawbacks that fixed-assignment protocols like time-division multiple access (TDMA) and RTDMA have. LTDMA, although belonging to this same family, suffers from reduced channel usage, wasted timeslots as well as network equipment overloading due to its fixed-sized timeslots. VPLAP, on the other hand, is tested using real LAN traffic traces and is proved not only to be successfully resolving the above issues but also being able to achieve a high throughput-delay performance when operating under realistic traffic conditions.},

abstract={With the popularity and development of distributed systems, the problem of integration of multiple access control mechanisms of information systems emerged inevitably. Theories on graph and state machine are used to research the mapping from local security mechanism to the global access control mechanism. An integration model: authorization propagation tree (APT) model which support DAC, MAC and RBAC is proposed to solve it in the paper. The paper also gives the formal definition and security proving of the security model based on APT},

abstract={The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) to formulate a decision fusion problem that is encountered in the design of a multi-modal identity verification system as a particular classification problem, and (2) to solve this problem by using a support vector machine (SVM). The multi-modal identity verification system under consideration is built of d modalities in parallel, each one delivering as output a scalar number, called a score, stating how well the claimed identity is verified. A fusion module receiving the d scores as input has to take a binary decision: to accept or reject the identity. This fusion problem has been solved using SVMs. The performance of this fusion module has been evaluated and compared with other proposed methods on a multi-modal database containing both vocal and visual modalities.},

abstract={Whether for development, maintenance or refactoring, multiple steps in software development cycle require comprehension of a program's access control model (AC model). In this paper, we present a novel approach to reverse-engineer AC model structure from PHP source code. Using an hybrid approach combining static analysis and model checking techniques, we are able to extract AC model structure in a fast and precise way. An experimental tool was developed to evaluate the presented approach and report AC models using source code coloring. For this case study, Moodle, a medium-scale (approx. 625K lines of code), open-source PHP application with a rich AC model was investigated. Results revealed that, although very complex by design, implemented AC models may comparatively be very simple, suggesting that developers tend to maintain a low complexity level when implementing ACs. Detailed figures and distributions are reported. We believe the presented tool and approach may help in understanding and evaluating the implemented AC models in Web systems. Discussion of findings, limitations, and further research are presented.},

title={Fast Detection of Access Control Vulnerabilities in PHP Applications}, 
year={2012}, 
month={Oct}, 
pages={247-256}, 
abstract={Access control vulnerabilities in web applications are on the rise. In its 2010 "Top 10 Most Critical Web Applications Security Risks", the OWASP reported that the prevalence of access control vulnerabilities in web applications increased compared to 2007. However, in contrast to SQL injection and cross-site scripting flaws, access control vulnerabilities comparatively received much less attention from the research community. This paper presents ACMA (Access Control Model Analyzer), a model checking-based tool for the detection of access control vulnerabilities in PHP applications. The core of ACMA uses a lightweight model checker to detect the privileges that are enforced at each statement of an application. Based on this information, ACMA can detect several types of access control vulnerabilities: from forced browsing vulnerabilities to faulty access controls. We show how, when compared to the state of the art, ACMA achieves advantageously comparable results with accelerations up to 890 times faster. Moreover, contrary to the state of the art, ACMA scales up to medium-large applications with large access control models, as shown by the analysis of Moodle, a 400,000+ LOC application counting more than 200 distinct privileges. Results show that ACMA is fast, precise and scalable making it a practical tool for the detection of access control vulnerabilities in real-world applications. A discussion about further extensions to ACMA is also presented.},

Checking (i) P-security (Goguen and Meseguer), (ii) IP-security (Haigh and Young), and (iii) TA-security (van der Meyden) are all in PTIME, while checking TO-security (van der Meyden) is undecidable. The most important ingredients in the proofs of the PTIME upper bounds are new characterizations of the respective security notions, which also enable the algorithms to return simple counterexamples demonstrating insecurity. Our results for IP-security improve a previous doubly exponential bound of Hadj-Alouane et al.},

abstract={The paper introduces a formal security model for a microprocessor hardware system. The model has been developed as part of the evaluation process of the processor product according to ITSEC assurance level E4. Novel aspects of the model are the need for defining integrity and confidentiality objectives on the hardware level without the operating system or application specification and security policy being given, and the utilization of an abstract function and data space. The security model consists of a system model given as a state transition automaton on infinite structures and the formalization of security objectives by means of properties of automaton behaviors. Validity of the security properties is proved. The paper compares the model with published ones and summarizes the lessons learned throughout the modeling process},

abstract={We present a method for designing a robust control policy for an uncertain system subject to temporal logic specifications. The system is modeled as a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP) whose transition probabilities are not exactly known but are known to belong to a given uncertainty set. A robust control policy is generated for the MDP that maximizes the worst-case probability of satisfying the specification over all transition probabilities in this uncertainty set. To this end, we use a procedure from probabilistic model checking to combine the system model with an automaton representing the specification. This new MDP is then transformed into an equivalent form that satisfies assumptions for stochastic shortest path dynamic programming. A robust version of dynamic programming solves for a ε-suboptimal robust control policy with time complexity O(log1/ε) times that for the non-robust case.},

title={Transforming traditional iris recognition systems to work on non-ideal situations}, 
year={2009}, 
month={March}, 
pages={1-8}, 
abstract={Non-ideal iris images can significantly affect the accuracy of iris recognition systems for two reasons: 1) they cannot be properly preprocessed by the system; and/or 2) they have poor image quality. However, many traditional iris recognition systems have been deployed in law enforcement, military, or many other important locations. It will be expensive to replace all these systems. It will be desirable if the traditional systems can be transformed to perform in non-ideal situations without an expensive update. In this paper, we propose a method that can help traditional iris recognition systems to work on the non-ideal situation using a video image approach. The proposed method will quickly identify and eliminate the bad quality images from iris videos for further processing. The segmentation accuracy is critical in recognition and would be challenging for traditional systems. The segmentation evaluation is designed to evaluate if the segmentation is valid. The information distance based quality measure is used to evaluate if the image has enough quality for recognition. The segmentation evaluation score and quality score are combined to predict the recognition performance. The research results show that the proposed methods can work effectively and objectively. The combination of segmentation and quality scores is highly correlated with the recognition accuracy and can be used to improve the performance of iris recognition systems in a non-ideal situation. The deployment of such a system would not cost much since the core parts of the traditional systems are not changed and we only need to add software modules. It will be very practical to transform the traditional system using the proposed method.},
