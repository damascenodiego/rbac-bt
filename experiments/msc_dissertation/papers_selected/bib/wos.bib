   abstract = {Recent studies show that configurations of network access control is one of the most complex and error prone network management tasks. For this reason, network misconfiguration becomes the main source for network unreachablility and vulnerability problems. In this paper, we present a novel approach that models the global end-to-end behavior of access control configurations of the entire network including routers, IPSec, firewalls, and NAT for unicast and multicast packets. Our model represents the network as a state machine where the packet header and location determines the state. The transitions in this model are determined by packet header information, packet location, and policy semantics for the devices being modeled. We encode the semantics of access control policies with Boolean functions using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We then use computation tree logic (CTL) and symbolic model checking to investigate all future and past states of this packet in the network and verify network reachability and security requirements. Thus, our contributions in this work is the global encoding for network configurations that allows for general reachability and security property-based verification using CTL model checking. We have implemented our approach in a tool called ConfigChecker. While evaluating ConfigChecker, we modeled and verified network configurations with thousands of devices and millions of configuration rules, thus demonstrating the scalability of this approach.},

   abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new paradigm for operating and managing computer networks. SDN enables logically-centralized control over network devices through a "controller" software that operates independently from the network hardware, and can be viewed as the network operating system. Network operators can run both inhouse and third-party SDN programs (often called applications) on top of the controller, e. g., to specify routing and access control policies. SDN opens up the possibility of applying formal methods to prove the correctness of computer networks. Indeed, recently much effort has been invested in applying finite state model checking to check that SDN programs behave correctly. However, in general, scaling these methods to large networks is challenging and, moreover, they cannot guarantee the absence of errors. We present VeriCon, the first system for verifying that an SDN program is correct on all admissible topologies and for all possible (infinite) sequences of network events. VeriCon either confirms the correctness of the controller program on all admissible network topologies or outputs a concrete counterexample. VeriCon uses first-order logic to specify admissible network topologies and desired network-wide invariants, and then implements classical Floyd-Hoare-Dijkstra deductive verification using Z3. Our preliminary experience indicates that VeriCon is able to rapidly verify correctness, or identify bugs, for a large repertoire of simple core SDN programs. VeriCon is compositional, in the sense that it verifies the correctness of execution of any single network event w.r.t. the specified invariant, and can thus scale to handle large programs. To relieve the burden of specifying inductive invariants from the programmer, VeriCon includes a separate procedure for inferring invariants, which is shown to be effective on simple controller programs. We view VeriCon as a first step en route to practical mechanisms for verifying network-wide invariants of SDN programs.},

In this paper, we focus on role-based access control (RBAC) models and more precisely on the verification of formal RBAC models. We propose a solution for this verification issue, based on the use of the Tamago platform. In Tamago, functional contracts can be defined with pre/postconditions and deterministic automata. The Tamago platform provides tools for static verifications of these contracts, generation of test scenarios from the abstract contracts and monitoring facilities for dynamic analyses. We have extended the platform to take into account AC aspects. AC rules, expressed in a subset of (EBSEC)-S-3, a process algebra-based language, are translated into pre and post conditions of new security contracts. We have also adapted the test case generator to derive suitable test scenarios and the monitoring framework by adding a new security component.},

The MAC simulation model is implemented on a real-time state machine algorithm that communicates with simulated fieldbus nodes to properly close the necessaries communication loops. All the MAC and communication simulations are PC-based and performed over the National Instruments LabVIEW (TM) platform, the proposed model can be considered hybrid because it is based both on technical FF specification and on experimental data acquired from the communication bus of a commercial fieldbus system.

   abstract = {Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most widespread security mechanisms in use today. Given the growing complexity of policy languages and access control systems, verifying that such systems enforce the desired invariants is recognized as a security problem of crucial importance. In the present paper, we develop a framework for the formal verification of grsecurity, an access control system developed on top of Unix/Linux systems. The verification problem in grsecurity presents much of the complexity of modern RBAC systems, due to the presence of policy state changes that may arise both from explicit administrative primitives supported by grsecurity, and as the result of the interaction with the underlying operating system facilities. We develop a formal semantics for grsecurity's RBAC system, based on a labelled transition system, and a sound abstraction of that semantics providing a bounded approximation, amenable to model checking. We report on the result of the experimental analysis conducted with gran, the model checker we implemented based on our abstract semantics, on existing public servers running grsecurity to implement their RBAC systems.},

Some of the most important features of HMBS are its ability to model hierarchy and synchronization of information; provision of mechanisms for specifying access structures, navigational contexts, access control, multiple tailored versions, and hierarchical views. Analysis of the underlying statechart machine allows verification of page reachability, valid paths, and other properties, thus providing mechanisms to support authors in the development of structured applications.},

In the paper, we introduce the logic PLTLmod, an extension of Linear-Time Temporal Logic LTL with past-time operators whose atomic formulae are defined from a first-order constraint language dealing with periodicity. Although the underlying constraint language is a fragment of Presburger arithmetic shown to admit a PSPACE-complete satisfiability problem, we establish that PLTLmod model-checking and satisfiability problems remain in PSPACE as plain LTL (full Presburger LTL is known to be highly undecidable). This is particularly interesting for dealing with periodicity constraints since the language of PLTLmod has a language more concise than existing languages and the temporalization of our first-order language of periodicity constraints has the same worst case complexity as the underlying constraint language. Finally, we show examples of introduction the quantification in the logical language that provide to PLTLmod, EXPSPACE-complete problems. As another application, we establish that the equivalence problem for extended single-string automata, known to express the equality of time granularities, is PSPACE-complete by designing a reduction from QBF and by using our results for PLTLmod.

   abstract = {Besides the overall budget for building the infrastructure of a healthcare- service- based virtual private network (VPN) in Taiwan, two issues were considered critical for its acceptance by the country's 17,000 plus medical institutions. One was who was to pay for the network (ADSL or modem) connection fee; the other was who was to pay for the firewall/ anti- virus software. This paper addresses the second issue by proposing an efficient freeware firewall, named card- assisted firewall (CAF), for NHI VPN edge-hosts, which is also an add-on-value application of the National Healthcare IC card that every insurant and medical professional has. The innovative concept is that any NHI VPN site (edge- host) can establish diversified secure- authenticated connections with other sites only by an authentication mechanism, which requires a NHI Java card state machine and the Access Control List of the host. It is different from two- factor authentication cards in four ways: (1) a PIN code is not a must; (2) it requires authentication with the remote IC card Data Centre; (3) the NHI cards are already available, no modification is needed, and there is no further cost for the deployment of the cards; (4) although the cards are in the reader, the communication cannot start unless the cards are in the corresponding states; i.e. the states allow communication. An implementation, on a Microsoft Windows XP platform, demonstrated the system's feasibility over an emulation of the NHI VPN framework. It maintained a high line speed, the driver took up 39 KB of disk space, installation was simple, not requiring any extra hardware or software, and the average packet processing time of the CAF driver measured was 0.3084 ms. The average overhead in comparing the Access Control List predefined routing in card, in an FTP testing experiment, was 5.7 mu s (receiving) and 8 mu s (sending).},

Since the definition of workflows with these security considerations is a complicated and error prone process rigorous verification techniques are desirable for uncovering logical errors and assuring correctness. We propose the use of an equation based method - the OTS/CafeOBJ method to model specify and verify workflows with such security considerations. Specifically, a workflow with the security considerations, is modeled as an OTS, a kind of transition system; the OTS is then specified in CafeOBJ , an algebraic specification language. We verify that the OTS has desired safety and liveness properties by using the CafeOBJ system as an interactive theorem prover. A case study on a sample workflow that deals with travel expense reimbursement is used to demonstrate our method.},

   abstract = {With the rapid evolution of the Internet, security has become a major area of concern and, consequently, an interesting research area. Different applications transmit sensitive information over the Internet, which creates increased chances for attackers to look into every piece of data, unless it is secured using secure socket layer (SSL) certificate. However, the present SSL certificates too face challenges because of various attacks, and these certificates need to be verified before transmitting information. In this paper, we show how the concepts of learning automata (LA) can be used to verify SSL certificates. The proposed LA-based system can detect safe or unsafe SSL certificates. The LA reward/penalty scheme is used to build the trust value for SSL certificates. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

QFilter is based on non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and rewrites user's queries such that parts violating access control rules are pre-pruned. Through analysis and experimental validation, we show that (1) QFilter guarantees that only permissible portion of data is returned to the authorized users, (2) such access controls can be efficiently enforced without relying on security features of underlying storage system, and (3) such independency makes QFilter capable of many emerging applications, such as in-network access control and access control outsourcing.},

Two approaches to reduce the size of the generated test suite were investigated. One is based on a set of six heuristics and the other directly generates a test suite from the finite state model using random selection of paths in the policy model. Empirical studies revealed that the second approach to test suite generation, combined with one or more heuristics, is most effective in the detection of both first-order mutation and malicious faults and generates a significantly smaller test suite than the one generated directly from the finite state models.},

   abstract = {Security analysis is a formal verification technique to ascertain certain desirable guarantees on the access control policy specification. Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for the use of formal verification techniques. While formal analysis on traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been done to some extent, recent extensions to RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we consider the temporal RBAC extensions and propose a formal technique using timed automata to perform security analysis by analyzing both safety and liveness properties. Using safety properties one ensures that something bad never happens while liveness properties show that some good state is also achieved. GTRBAC is a well accepted generalized temporal RBAC model which can handle a wide range of temporal constraints while specifying different access control policies. Analysis of such a model involves a process of mapping a GTRBAC based system into a state transition system. Different reduction rules are proposed to simplify the modeling process depending upon the constraints supported by the system. The effect of different constraints on the modeling process is also studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the proposed approach, at first the GTRBAC system is mapped to a state transition system built using timed automata. Characteristics of each role, user and permission are captured with the help of timed automata. A single global clock is used to express the various temporal constraints supported in a GTRBAC model. Next, a set of safety and liveness properties is specified using computation tree logic (CTL). Model checking based formal verification is then done to verify the properties against the model to determine if the system is secure with respect to a given set of access control policies. Both time and space analysis has been done for studying the performance of the approach under different configurations.},

In this work, we identify ways to increase the scope of application of probabilistic model checking to the 802.11 MAC. Current techniques model only specialized cases of minimum size. To work around this problem, we identify properties of the protocol that can be used to simplify the models and make verification feasible. Using these observations, we present generalized probabilistic timed automata models that are independent of the number of stations. We optimize these through a novel abstraction technique while preserving probabilistic reachability measures. We substantiate our claims of a significant reduction due to our optimization with results from using the probabilistic model checker PRISM.},

In recent years the need for a formal understanding of the structures, the dynamic aspects and the processes of these coalitions has grown. In my ongoing thesis I propose a formal framework based on the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in order to grasp and characterize dynamic coalitions in general and privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions in particular. The ASM formalism allows for a structural description of dynamic coalitions as well as for a formalization of the inherent processes by means of ASM-runs, thereby enabling simulation, testing, and verification possibilities for the design of supporting architectures. This paper shows how the CoreASM-toolset is used to develop an abstract model of dynamic coalitions and extended to integrate trust-based access control mechanisms in order to enforce privacy aspects in highly dynamic coalitions. Finally an ongoing case study is introduced and first insights to the usability of the proposed model are given.},

Our computational approach is hierarchical. At the bottom level, we partition the environment and construct an abstraction in the form of a finite transition system such that the quadrotor can execute its transitions by using low level feedback controllers. At the top level, we draw inspiration from LTL model checking and use a value iteration algorithm to determine an optimal control policy that guarantees the satisfaction of the specification under nondeterministically changing properties. We illustrate the approach for the particular case of a surveillance mission in a city-like environment.},

The goal is to control the robot such that the probability of satisfying the mission specification is maximized. We propose a computationally efficient incremental algorithm based on the fact that temporal logic verification is computationally cheaper than synthesis. We present several case studies where we compare our approach to the classical non-incremental approach in terms of computation time and memory usage.},

   abstract = {The verification of access controls is essential for providing secure systems. Model checking is an automated technique used for verifying finite state machines. The properties to be verified are usually expressed as formula in temporal logic. In this paper we present an approach to verify access control security properties of a security annotated business process model. To this end we utilise a security enhanced BPMN notation to define access control properties. To enhance the usability the complex and technical details are hidden from the process modeller by using an automatic translation of the process model into a process meta language (Promela) based on Coloured Petri net (CPN) semantics. The model checker SPIN is used for the process model verification and a trace file is written to provide visual feedback to the modeller on the abstraction level of the verified process model. As a proof of concept the described translation methodology is implemented as a plug-in for the free web-based BPMN modelling tool Oryx.},

   abstract = {We consider the synthesis of control policies from temporal logic specifications for robots that interact with multiple dynamic environment agents. Each environment agent is modeled by a Markov chain whereas the robot is modeled by a finite transition system (in the deterministic case) or Markov decision process (in the stochastic case). Existing results in probabilistic verification are adapted to solve the synthesis problem. To partially address the state explosion issue, we propose an incremental approach where only a small subset of environment agents is incorporated in the synthesis procedure initially and more agents are successively added until we hit the constraints on computational resources. Our algorithm runs in an anytime fashion where the probability that the robot satisfies its specification increases as the algorithm progresses.},

   abstract = {The development of a high-throughput and low-cost medium access control (MAC) layer design is a very important issue for wireless local area network (WLAN) communication. In this paper, the proposed MAC-layer hardware architecture is simplified by using a small number of finite state machines (FSMs) and a low-latency parallel processing architecture. The FSMs on both the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) sides can be operated at low power. In the MAC-layer receiver, an efficient low-complexity timestamp controller is proposed for fast timing synchronization. We implement the distributed coordination function (DCF) of the MAC protocol in IEEE 802.11a/b/g standards within the ad-hoc configuration. The proposed MAC-layer hardware is implemented with Xilinx XC4VLX60 FPGA, the hardware area needs 5944 slices, and the effective throughput is 147.6 Mbps. With TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS process, the effective throughput at the maximum working frequency 83.3 MHz is 299.88 Mbps, which is larger than the standard IEEE 802.11 g requirement, i.e. 54 Mbps.},
