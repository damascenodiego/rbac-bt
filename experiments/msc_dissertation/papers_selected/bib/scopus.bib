abstract={The emerging multimedia communications are expected to enable simultaneous services with high throughput and low-latency requirements. Ensuring appropriate quality of service (QoS) for multimedia services is one of the challenges that network operators have to cope with in the Evolved Packet System (EPS). The mechanism which allows policy based authorization and usage control of QoS resources intended for multimedia traffic in EPS is called Policy and Charging Control (PCC). The paper investigates the capabilities for open access to PCC. The open access allows third party applications to access functions in the telecommunication networks through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The support of standardized APIs for PCC is evaluated. An approach to design new APIs for PCC is described. APIs implementation issues are addressed including interface-to-protocol mapping. The functional verification of application server for open access to PCC functions is formalized. The application server’s functional behaviour is modelled and adaptive load control mechanism is proposed. The application server performance and utilization are evaluated.},

abstract={In this research we present a technique by using which, extended UML models can be converted to standard UML models so that existing MBT techniques can be applied directly on these models. Existing Model Based Testing (MBT) Techniques cannot be directly applied to extended UML models due to the difference of modeling notation and new model elements. Verification of these models is also very important. Realizing and testing non functional requirements such as efficiency, portability and security, at model level strengthens the ability of model to turn down risk, cost and probability of system failure in cost effective way. Access control is most widely used technique for implementing security in software systems. Existing approaches for security modeling focus on representation of access control policies such as authentication, role based access control by introducing security oriented model elements through extension in Unified Modelling Language (UML). But doing so hinders the potential and application of MBT techniques to verify these models and test access control policies. In this research we introduce a technique secure State UML to formally design security models with secure UML and then transform it to UML state machine diagrams so that it can be tested, verified by existing MBT techniques. By applying proposed technique on case studies, we found the results that MBT techniques can be applied on resulting state machine diagrams and generated test paths have potential to identify the risks associated with security constraints violation.},

abstract={Obligations are mandatory actions that users must perform, addressing access control requirements. To ensure that such obligations are implemented correctly, an automated and systematic testing approach is often recommended. One such approach is Model-Based Testing (MBT) that allows defining cost-effective testing strategies to support rigorous testing via automation. In this paper, we present MBT for obligations by extending the Unified Modeling Language (UML) via a profile called the Obligations Profile. Based on the profile, we define a modeling methodology utilizing the concepts of Obligations Class Diagrams (OCDs) and Obligations State Machines (OSMs), which are standard UML Class Diagrams and UML State Machines with stereotypes from the Obligations Profile. Our methodology, using OCDs and OSMs, is automatically enforced by the validation of constraints defined in the profile. To assess the completeness and applicability of the profile and methodology, we modeled 47 obligations from four different systems. The results of our case study show that we successfully modeled all the obligations and used 75% of the stereotypes that we defined in the profile. In addition, using OCDs and OSMs, we automatically generate executable test cases using a standard state machine structural coverage criterion and common test data generation strategies. The effectiveness of generated test cases is assessed using mutation analysis on two systems, using mutation operators specifically designed for obligation faults. Test case execution killed 75% of the mutants and a careful analysis further suggests that more sophisticated testing strategies must be defined to further improve testing effectiveness.},

abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new paradigm for operating and managing computer networks. SDN enables logicallycentralized control over network devices through a "controller" software that operates independently from the network hardware, and can be viewed as the network operating system. Network operators can run both inhouse and third-party SDN programs (often called applications) on top of the controller, e.g., to specify routing and access control policies. SDN opens up the possibility of applying formal methods to prove the correctness of computer networks. Indeed, recently much effort has been invested in applying finite state model checking to check that SDN programs behave correctly. However, in general, scaling these methods to large networks is challenging and, moreover, they cannot guarantee the absence of errors.
We present VeriCon, the first system for verifying that an SDN program is correct on all admissible topologies and for all possible (infinite) sequences of network events. VeriCon either confirms the correctness of the controller program on all admissible network topologies or outputs a concrete counterexample. VeriCon uses first-order logic to specify admissible network topologies and desired network-wide invariants, and then implements classical Floyd-Hoare-Dijkstra deductive verification using Z3. Our preliminary experience indicates that VeriCon is able to rapidly verify correctness, or identify bugs, for a large repertoire of simple core SDN programs. VeriCon is compositional, in the sense that it verifies the correctness of execution of any single network event w.r.t. the specified invariant, and can thus scale to handle large programs. To relieve the burden of specifying inductive invariants from the programmer, VeriCon includes a separate procedure for inferring invariants, which is shown to be effective on simple controller programs.

abstract={Large, complex, rapidly evolving pieces of software such as operating systems are notoriously difficult to prove correct. Developers instead describe expected behaviour through assertions and check actual behaviour through testing. However, many dynamic safety properties cannot be validated this way as they are temporal: They depend on events in the past or future and are not easily expressed in assertions. TESLA is a description, analysis, and validation tool that allows systems programmers to describe expected temporal behaviour in low-level languages such as C. Temporal assertions can span the interfaces between libraries and even languages. TESLA exposes run-time behaviour using program instrumentation, illuminating coverage of complex state machines and detecting violations of specifications. We apply TESLA to complex software, including an OpenSSL security API, the FreeBSD Mandatory Access Control framework, and GNUstep's rendering engine. With performance allowing "always-on" availability, we demonstrate that existing systems can benefit from richer dynamic analysis without being re-written for amenability to a complete formal analysis.

The mission specification is given as a syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic formula over some properties that hold at the vertices of the environment. The robot is assumed to be a deterministic transition system, while the agents are probabilistic Markov models. The goal is to control the robot such that the probability of satisfying the mission specification is maximized. We propose a computationally efficient incremental algorithm based on the fact that temporal logic verification is computationally cheaper than synthesis. We present several case studies where we compare our approach to the classical non-incremental approach in terms of computation time and memory usage. © The Author(s) 2014.},

MAC protocols are generally viewed as sequential extended state-machines and therefore MAC parallelization has not yet been widely considered. In this paper, we show that MAC execution efficiency can be substantially increased by exploiting parallelism and by providing the necessary hardware-software support. In particular, we enable dual-processor interrupt-driven hardware architecture and support a customized real-time operating system kernel on the widely used WARP SDR platform. Moreover, we integrate it with our framework for composing MAC protocols based on their elementary functionalities. We describe the architectural details of the system and discuss strategies for efficient scheduling of different MAC processes. We evaluate our system in realistic application test-cases. Our empirical results show that by exploiting parallelism, our system achieves significant improvements in MAC execution speed compared to the contemporary sequential implementation approach. © 2014 ACM.},

Security requirements such as access or information control tend to increase the complexity of functional requirements, and therefore, need to be correctly implemented to minimize risks. However, general developers find it difficult to correctly specify adequate security requirements during the initial phases of the software development process. We propose a method to verify security requirements whose specifications are based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) using the model checking technique and Common Criteria security knowledge. Common Criteria assists in defining adequate security requirements in the form of a table. This helps developers verify whether UML-based requirements analysis models meet those requirements in the early stages of software development. The UML model and the table are transformed into a finite automaton in the UPPAAL model checking tool.},

abstract={Access control mechanisms protect critical resources of systems from unauthorized access. In a policy-based management approach, administrators define user privileges as rules that determine the conditions and the extent of users' access rights. As rules become more complex, analytical skills are required to identify conflicts and interactions within the rules that comprise a system policy - especially when rules are stateful and depend on event histories. Without adequate tool support such an analysis is error-prone and expensive. In consequence, many policy specifications are inconsistent or conflicting that render the system insecure. The security of the system, however, does not only depend on the correct specification of the security policy, but in a large part also on the correct interpretation of those rules by the system's enforcement mechanism. In this paper, we show how policy rules can be formalized in Fusion Logic, a temporal logic for the specification of behavior of systems. A symbolic decision procedure for Fusion Logic based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) is provided and we introduce a novel technique for the construction of enforcement mechanisms of access control policy rules that uses a BDD encoded enforcement automaton based on input traces which reflect state changes in the system. We provide examples of verification of policy rules, such as absence of conflicts, and dynamic separation of duty and of the enforcement of policies using our prototype implementation (FLCheck) for which we detail the underlying theory. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The missions are specified as rich, temporal logic statements about the satisfaction of the properties. The main objective is to be able to synthesize, test, and evaluate control policies for complex aerial missions. Our testbed consists of quadrotors, a motion capture system that provides precise and continuous position information of the quadrotor, projectors that can emulate dynamically changing environments, physical obstacles, and computers that control the quadrotor, the motion capture system, and the projectors. Our computational approach is hierarchical. At the bottom level, we partition the environment and construct an abstraction in the form of a finite transition system such that the quadrotor can execute its transitions by using low level feedback controllers. At the top level, we draw inspiration from LTL model checking and use a value iteration algorithm to determine an optimal control policy that guarantees the satisfaction of the specification under nondeterministically changing properties. We illustrate the approach for the particular case of a surveillance mission in a city-like environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern networking technologies, such as Cloud or SOA, enable cooperations and individuals to form dynamic coalitions for temporary sharing of resources and information in order to achieve a common goal. In recent years the need for a formal understanding of the structures, the dynamic aspects and the processes of these coalitions has grown. In my ongoing thesis I propose a formal framework based on the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in order to grasp and characterize dynamic coalitions in general and privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions in particular. The ASM formalism allows for a structural description of dynamic coalitions as well as for a formalization of the inherent processes by means of ASM-runs, thereby enabling simulation, testing, and verification possibilities for the design of supporting architectures. This paper shows how the CoreASM-toolset is used to develop an abstract model of dynamic coalitions and extended to integrate trust-based access control mechanisms in order to enforce privacy aspects in highly dynamic coalitions. Finally an ongoing case study is introduced and first insights to the usability of the proposed model are given. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The verification of Spatio-Temporal Role Based Access Control policies (STRBAC) during the early development life cycle improves the security of the software. It helps to identify inconsistencies in the Access Control policies before proceeding to other phases where the cost of fixing defects is augmented. This paper proposes a formal method for an automatic analysis of STRBAC policies. It ensures that the policies are consistent and conflict-free. The method proposed in this paper makes the use of Timed Automata to verify the STRBAC policies. This is done by translating the STRBAC model into Timed Automata, and then the produced Timed Automata is implemented and verified using the model checker UPPAAL. This paper presents a security query expressed using TCTL to detect inconsistency caused due to the interaction between STRBAC policies. With the help of an example, this paper shows how we convert STRBAC model to Timed Automata models and verify the resulting models using the UPPAAL to identify an erroneous design. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Access control model is widely used in access control politics testing, it usually consists of three hierarchy fields: roles, permissions and contexts. But the relations information between the three fields is not taken into consideration intact when building the access control models. Because of the information is leaking, engineers has to use random testing or pairwise testing when using access control model, they has to exchange test coverage for test efficiency. Some researchers extended the original access control model with rules, priority and status in order to complementary the missing information, but due to the structure disadvantage of original access control model, few works showed promising result. This paper presents a method using labeled transition system model in formalizing software access control politics though several examples, the method can formalize key information like rules, priority and status along with roles, permissions and contexts into model. This paper also briefly introduces how to use labeled transition system model in security test cases automatic generating. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider the synthesis of control policies from temporal logic specifications for robots that interact with multiple dynamic environment agents. Each environment agent is modeled by a Markov chain whereas the robot is modeled by a finite transition system (in the deterministic case) or Markov decision process (in the stochastic case). Existing results in probabilistic verification are adapted to solve the synthesis problem. To partially address the state explosion issue, we propose an incremental approach where only a small subset of environment agents is incorporated in the synthesis procedure initially and more agents are successively added until we hit the constraints on computational resources. Our algorithm runs in an anytime fashion where the probability that the robot satisfies its specification increases as the algorithm progresses. © 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we focus on role-based access control (RBAC) models and more precisely on the verification of formal RBAC models. We propose a solution for this verification issue, based on the use of the Tam ago platform. In Tam ago, functional contracts can be defined with pre/post conditions and deterministic automata. The Tam ago platform provides tools for static verifications of these contracts, generation of test scenarios from the abstract contracts and monitoring facilities for dynamic analyses. We have extended the platform to take into account AC aspects. AC rules, expressed in a subset of EB3SEC, a process algebra-based language, are translated into pre and post conditions of new security contracts. We have also adapted the test case generator to derive suitable test scenarios and the monitoring framework by adding a new security component. © 2012 C.E.S.A.M.E.S.},

abstract={We propose a novel scheme for proving administrative role-based access control (ARBAC) policies correct with respect to security properties using the powerful abstraction-based tools available for program verification. Our scheme uses a combination of abstraction and reduction to program verification to perform security analysis. We convert ARBAC policies to imperative programs that simulate the policy abstractly, and then utilize further abstract- interpretation techniques from program analysis to analyze the programs in order to prove the policies secure. We argue that the aggressive set-abstractions and numerical-abstractions we use are natural and appropriate in the access control setting. We implement our scheme using a tool called VAC that translates ARBAC policies to imperative programs followed by an interval-based static analysis of the program, and show that we can effectively prove access control policies correct. The salient feature of our approach are the abstraction schemes we develop and the reduction of role-based access control security (which has nothing to do with programs) to program verification problems. © 2012, Daniel Hedin.},

abstract={Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most widespread security mechanisms in use today. Given the growing complexity of policy languages and access control systems, verifying that such systems enforce the desired invariants is recognized as a security problem of crucial importance. In the present paper, we develop a framework for the formal verification of grsecurity, an access control system developed on top of Unix/Linux systems. The verification problem in grsecurity presents much of the complexity of modern RBAC systems, due to the presence of policy state changes that may arise both from explicit administrative primitives supported by grsecurity, and as the result of the interaction with the underlying operating system facilities. We develop a formal semantics for grsecurity's RBAC system, based on a labelled transition system, and a sound abstraction of that semantics providing a bounded approximation, amenable to model checking. We report on the result of the experimental analysis conducted with gran, the model checker we implemented based on our abstract semantics, on existing public servers running grsecurity to implement their RBAC systems. © 2012, Daniel Hedin.},

abstract={Safety evaluations of high-security database management systems (DBMS) need to be guided by an adequate security policy model and a test suite that are automatically generated according to the testing requirements. The access control policy components of the second part of the common criteria and elements of the label security component in current commercial DBMS products, such as the security level, category and group of the mandatory access control (MAC) components, are used to define a database label model based on the finite state mechanism. The system also gives handling mechanisms between various elements of components with read/write policy rules for labeling component elements binding database subjects and database objects. A formal model is gives for a five-tuple automaton for database label security and a graphics-traverse search method to produce a state transition tree and transition sequences for the migration coverage criteria of the five-tuple automaton. W3C State Chart XML (SCXML) is used to describe the five-tuple automaton with a method to process the SCXML of the five-tuple automaton. A security policy example is given for high-security DBMS to illustrate the process to produce the coverage test suite for DBMS security label assessment.},

abstract={This paper presents the Cybernetic Education Centre (CEDUC) as a hybrid e-learning and training centre for higher education of Cybernetics and Automation fields. If we consider Cybernetics we consider basically (1) controlled systems and (2) control systems. In case of controlled systems learner is focused on the process of analyze, identification, design of the mathematical model and simulation of the controlled system. Therefore this paper deals with controlled models in the laboratories of our department (a) real laboratory models, (b) simulation models and (c) virtual models which creates one integrated hybrid architecture what represents one of new ideas in the paper (Fig. 1). Learner of control systems is focused mainly on design of control parameters, design of control algorithms, design of hardware, software and communication architectures of control systems. Overall control system is represented by Distributed Control System (DCS) which serves for learners to verify designed control systems. The verification of the control systems is very important from safety point of view to prepare learners for real production conditions. Second new idea of the paper is implementation of the Coloured Petri Nets as automata to control access to the resources (not only typical study resources but also access to the components of hybrid DCS architecture) as well as to monitor the learner activities during the study. CEDUC is supported by intensive industry-university partnership. Conclusion of the paper summarizes the results of the study process of learners in DCS environment. © 2012 IEEE.},

One of ASLan's core features over IF is to integrate a transition system with Horn clauses that are evaluated at every state. This allows for modeling many common situations in security such as the interaction between the workflow of a system with its access control policies. While even the transition relation is undecidable for ASLan in general, we show the security problem is decidable for a large and useful fragment that we call TASLan, as long as we bound the number of steps of honest participants. The restriction of TASLan is that all messages and predicates must be in a certain sense unambiguous in their interpretation, excluding "type-confusions" similar to some tagging results for security protocols. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Recent studies show that configurations of network access control is one of the most complex and error prone network management tasks. For this reason, network misconfiguration becomes the main source for network unreachablility and vulnerability problems. In this paper, we present a novel approach that models the global end-to-end behavior of access control configurations of the entire network including routers, IPSec, firewalls, and NAT for unicast and multicast packets. Our model represents the network as a state machine where the packet header and location determines the state. The transitions in this model are determined by packet header information, packet location, and policy semantics for the devices being modeled. We encode the semantics of access control policies with Boolean functions using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We then use computation tree logic (CTL) and symbolic model checking to investigate all future and past states of this packet in the network and verify network reachability and security requirements. Thus, our contributions in this work is the global encoding for network configurations that allows for general reachability and security property-based verification using CTL model checking. We have implemented our approach in a tool called ConfigChecker. While evaluating ConfigChecker, we modeled and verified network configurations with thousands of devices and millions of configuration rules, thus demonstrating the scalability of this approach.

QFilter is based on non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and rewrites user's queries such that parts violating access control rules are pre-pruned.

abstract={Security analysis is a formal verification technique to ascertain certain desirable guarantees on the access control policy specification. Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for the use of formal verification techniques. While formal analysis on traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been done to some extent, recent extensions to RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we consider the temporal RBAC extensions and propose a formal technique using timed automata to perform security analysis by analyzing both safety and liveness properties. Using safety properties one ensures that something bad never happens while liveness properties show that some good state is also achieved. GTRBAC is a well accepted generalized temporal RBAC model which can handle a wide range of temporal constraints while specifying different access control policies. Analysis of such a model involves a process of mapping a GTRBAC based system into a state transition system. Different reduction rules are proposed to simplify the modeling process depending upon the constraints supported by the system. The effect of different constraints on the modeling process is also studied. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We show the process of dynamic permission adjustment in multi-domain environment, and illustrate two classes of problems in the process which can be reduced to similar analysis in the RT[←,∩] role-based trust-management language, thereby establishing an interesting relationship between MDR 2BAC and the RT framework.

abstract={In 2004, the White House and then Congress determined there should be an "Information Sharing Environment" that facilitates the flow of critical information for counter-terrorism, related law enforcement, and disaster management activities. That work has been progressing but a major challenge is how to create technologies that: ensure compliance with laws and policies of the federal government, 50 states, and individual agencies; convey appropriate data that would support access control and privilege decisions in different jurisdictions; and achieve accountability and transparency for this activity. We have built a prototype of Fusion Center information sharing that shows significant progress in the representation of law in a policy language, the reasoning of that law over data transactions occurring in a web environment (internet or intranet), acquiring necessary information from authoritative sources wherever they reside in the decentralized environment, and providing both a binary response suitable for automated workflow implementation and a detailed justification suitable for human validation of the conclusion. In this paper, we briefly describe the technologies employed for serializing the data and policy, reasoning over the rules contained in the policy, and displaying the results to users. These combine to provide a powerful tool supporting a range of necessary governmental functions including access control, privilege management, audit, periodic reporting, and risk modeling. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of a high-throughput and low-cost medium access control (MAC) layer design is a very important issue for wireless local area network (WLAN) communication. In this paper, the proposed MAC-layer hardware architecture is simplified by using a small number of finite state machines (FSMs) and a low-latency parallel processing architecture. The FSMs on both the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) sides can be operated at low power. In the MAC-layer receiver, an efficient low-complexity timestamp controller is proposed for fast timing synchronization. We implement the distributed coordination function (DCF) of the MAC protocol in IEEE 802.11a/b/g standards within the ad-hoc configuration. The proposed MAC-layer hardware is implemented with Xilinx XC4VLX60 FPGA, the hardware area needs 5944 slices, and the effective throughput is 147.6 Mbps. With TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS process, the effective throughput at the maximum working frequency 83.3 MHz is 299.88 Mbps, which is larger than the standard IEEE 802.11 g requirement, i.e. 54 Mbps.},

These type inference algorithms are directly applicable to XML static typechecking, which is the problem of verifying whether, a given document transformation always converts source documents of a given input type into documents of a given output type. We show that typechecking for arbitrary sequences of XML update primitives can be done in polynomial time when the unranked tree automaton defining the output type is deterministic and complete, and that it is EXPTIME-complete otherwise. We then apply the results to the verification of access control policies for XML updates.

abstract={Recent studies show that configurations of network access control is one of the most complex and error prone network management tasks. For this reason, network misconfiguration becomes the main source for network unreachablility and vulnerability problems. In this paper, we present a novel approach that models the global end-to-end behavior of access control configurations of the entire network including routers, IPSec, firewalls, and NAT for unicast and multicast packets. Our model represents the network as a state machine where the packet header and location determines the state. The transitions in this model are determined by packet header information, packet location, and policy semantics for the devices being modeled. We encode the semantics of access control policies with Boolean functions using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We then use computation tree logic (CTL) and symbolic model checking to investigate all future and past states of this packet in the network and verify network reachability and security requirements. Thus, our contributions in this work is the global encoding for network configurations that allows for general reachability and security property-based verification using CTL model checking. We have implemented our approach in a tool called ConfigChecker. While evaluating ConfigChecker, we modeled and verified network configurations with thousands of devices and millions of configuration rules, thus demonstrating the scalability of this approach. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Trust management is a scalable and flexible form of access control that relies heavily on delegation techniques. While these techniques may be necessary in large or decentralized systems, stakeholders need an analysis methodology and automated tools for reasoning about who will have access to their resources today as well as in the future. When an access control policy fails to satisfy the policy author's security objectives, tools should provide information that demonstrate how and why the failure occurred. Such information is useful in that it may assist policy authors in constructing policies that satisfy security objectives, which support policy authoring and maintenance. This paper presents a collection of reduction, optimization, and verification techniques useful in determining whether security properties are satisfied by RT policies. We provide proofs of correctness as well as demonstrate the degree of effectiveness and efficiency the techniques provide through empirical evaluation. While the type of analysis problem we examine is generally intractable, we demonstrate that our reduction and optimization techniques may be able to reduce problem instances into a form that can be automatically verified.

We assume that the behavior of the system is modeled by a labeled transition system and assume the existence of a black-box implementation. We first outline a method allowing to automatically compute an ideal access control ensuring these two kinds of properties. Then, we show how to derive testers that test the conformance of the implementation with respect to its specification, the correctness of the real access control that has been composed with the implementation in order to ensure a security property, and the security property itself. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={An access control system is often viewed as a state transition system. Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for formal verification. While formal analysis on traditional RBAC has been done to some extent, the extensions of RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we propose a formal technique to perform security analysis on the Generalized Temporal RBAC (GTRBAC) model which can be used to express a wide range of temporal constraints on different RBAC components like role, user and permission. In the proposed approach, at first the GTRBAC system is mapped to a state transition system built using timed automata. Characteristics of each role, user and permission are captured with the help of timed automata. A single global clock is used to express the various temporal constraints supported in a GTRBAC model. Next, a set of safety and liveness properties is specified using computation tree logic (CTL). Model checking based formal verification is then done to verify the properties against the model to determine if the system is secure with respect to a given set of access control policies. Both time and space analysis has been done for studying the performance of the approach under different configurations. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

The properties to be verified are usually expressed as formula in temporal logic. In this paper we present an approach to verify access control security properties of a security annotated business process model. To this end we utilise a security enhanced BPMN notation to define access control properties. To enhance the usability the complex and technical details are hidden from the process modeller by using an automatic translation of the process model into a process meta language (Promela) based on Coloured Petri net (CPN) semantics. The model checker SPIN is used for the process model verification and a trace file is written to provide visual feedback to the modeller on the abstraction level of the verified process model. As a proof of concept the described translation methodology is implemented as a plug-in for the free web-based BPMN modelling tool Oryx. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg Business.},

Two approaches to reduce the size of the generated test suite were investigated. One is based on a set of six heuristics and the other directly generates a test suite from the finite state model using random selection of paths in the policy model. Empirical studies revealed that the second approach to test suite generation, combined with one or more heuristics, is most effective in the detection of both first-order mutation and malicious faults and generates a significantly smaller test suite than the one generated directly from the finite state models. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Web services choreography is used to design peer-to-peer applications where each peer is potentially a Web service. It defines the required behavior of participating Web services along with their interactions through message exchanges. Implementing a complex system described by a choreography requires selecting actual Web services whose individual behaviors are compatible with the overall behavior described by the choreography. Although the selected Web services implement the specified behavior, they may not be able to interact due to the policies they enforce to protect their resources. A Web service'resource can be an operation or a credential type to be submitted to be able to invoke an operation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to determine at design time whether a choreography can be implemented by a set of Web services based on their access control policies and the disclosure policies regulating the release of their credentials. We model both Web services and Web services choreography as transition systems and represent Web services credential disclosure policies as directed graphs. We then verify that all possible conversations of the Web services choreography can be implemented by matching credential disclosure policies of the invoker Web service with the access control policy of the Web services being invoked. We propose a resource release graph to enable this verification. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Besides the overall budget for building the infrastructure of a healthcare-service-based virtual private network (VPN) in Taiwan, two issues were considered critical for its acceptance by the country's 17,000 plus medical institutions. One was who was to pay for the network (ADSL or modem) connection fee; the other was who was to pay for the firewall/anti-virus software. This paper addresses the second issue by proposing an efficient freeware firewall, named card-assisted firewall (CAF), for NHI VPN edge-hosts, which is also an add-on-value application of the National Healthcare IC card that every insurant and medical professional has. The innovative concept is that any NHI VPN site (edge-host) can establish diversified secure-authenticated connections with other sites only by an authentication mechanism, which requires a NHI Java card state machine and the Access Control List of the host. It is different from two-factor authentication cards in four ways: (1) a PIN code is not a must; (2) it requires authentication with the remote IC card Data Centre; (3) the NHI cards are already available, no modification is needed, and there is no further cost for the deployment of the cards; (4) although the cards are in the reader, the communication cannot start unless the cards are in the corresponding states; i.e. the states allow communication. An implementation, on a Microsoft Windows XP platform, demonstrated the system's feasibility over an emulation of the NHI VPN framework. It maintained a high line speed, the driver took up 39 KB of disk space, installation was simple, not requiring any extra hardware or software, and the average packet processing time of the CAF driver measured was 0.3084 ms. The average overhead in comparing the Access Control List predefined routing in card, in an FTP testing experiment, was 5.7μs (receiving) and 8μs (sending). © 2007 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract={A number of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) techniques for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have been proposed in the research literature. These techniques include trust building and cluster-based voting schemes, statistical anomaly detection, host-based watchdogs, and finite state machines for specifying correct routing behavior. Comparing and evaluating the effectiveness of these IDS techniques has been hindered by the limited number of large-scale MANET deployments, the lack of publicly available network traces of actual MANET traffic, and the difficulty in defining typical application and mobility scenarios. Network simulation tools have allowed researchers to study MANET IDSs without purchasing mobile nodes or conducting costly and time-consuming field trial tests. These simulations, however, have been conducted using widely varying assumptions on background network traffic, mobility, previous security associations, and the type of malicious network activity. This paper describes how we use our mLab testbed to create publicly available MANET network traces. These network traces allow researchers to compare the effectiveness of different MANET IDS techniques on the same data set, and conduct offline experiments with new IDS techniques without requiring expensive hardware. © 2007 IEEE.},

The property of main interest is detecting and resolving collision. Evaluation of this property for all connected topologies requires more than 8000 model checking runs. Increasing the number of nodes would not only lead increase the state space, but to a greater extent cause an instance explosion problem.

abstract={Nowadays, security policies are the key point of every modern infrastructure. The specification and the testing of such policies are the fundamental steps in the development of a secure system since any error in a set of rules is likely to harm the global security. To address both challenges, we propose a framework to specify security policies and test their implementation on a system. Our framework makes it possible to generate in an automatic manner, test sequences, in order to validate the conformance of a security policy. system behavior is specified using a formal description technique based on extended finite state machine (EFSM) [12]. The integration of security rules within the system specification is performed by specific algorithms. Then, the automatic tests generation is performed using a dedicated tool, called SIRIUS, developed in our laboratory. Finally, we briefly present a weblog system as a case study to demonstrate the reliability of our framework. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

Since the definition of workflows with these security considerations is a complicated and error-prone process, rigorous verification techniques are desirable for uncovering logical errors and assuring correctness. We propose the use of an equation-based method - the OTS/Cafe OBJ method to model, specify and verify workflows with such security considerations. Specifically, a workflow with the security considerations, is modeled as an OTS, a kind of transition system; the OTS is then specified in CafeOBJ, an algebraic specification language. We verify that the OTS has desired safety and liveness properties by using the CafeOBJ system as an interactive theorem prover. A case study on a sample workflow that deals with travel expense reimbursement is used to demonstrate our method. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodology for random testing of software models. Random testing tools can be used very effectively early in the modeling process, e.g., while writing formal requirements specification for a given system. In this phase users cannot know whether a correct operational model is being built or whether the properties that the model must satisfy are correctly identified and stated. So it is very useful to have tools to quickly identify errors in the operational model or in the properties, and make appropriate corrections. Using Lurch, our random testing tool for finite-state models, we evaluated the effectiveness of random model testing by detecting manually seeded errors in an SCR specification of a real-world personnel access control system. Having detected over 80% of seeded errors quickly, our results appear to be very encouraging. We further defined and measured test coverage metrics with the goal of understanding why some of the mutants were not detected. Coverage measures allowed us to understand the pitfalls of random testing of formal models, thus providing opportunities for future improvement. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper we describe an experiment in which inconsistent results between two tools for testing formal models (and a third used to determine which of the two was correct) led us to a more careful look at the way each tool was being used and a clearer understanding of the output of the tools. For the experiment, we created error-seeded versions of an SCR specification representing a real-world personnel access control system. They were checked using the model checker SPIN and Lurch, our random testing tool for finite-state models. In one case a property violation was detected by Lurch, an incomplete tool, but missed by SPIN, a model checking tool designed for complete verification. We used the SCR Toolset and the Salsa invariant checker to determine that the violation detected by Lurch was indeed present in the specification. We then looked more carefully at how we were using SPIN in conjunction with the SCR Toolset and, eventually, made adjustments so that SPIN also detected the property violation initially detected only by Lurch. Once it was clear the tools were being used correctly and would give consistent results, we did an experiment to determine how they could be combined to optimize completeness and efficiency. We found that combining tools made it possible to verify the specifications faster and with much less memory in most cases. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Current IEEE 802.11 wireless networks are vulnerable to session hijacking attacks as the existing standards fail to address the lack of authentication of management frames and network card addresses, and rely on loosely coupled state machines. Even the new WLAN security standard - IEEE 802.11i does not address these issues. In our previous work, we proposed two new techniques for improving detection of session hijacking attacks that are passive, computationally inexpensive, reliable, and have minimal impact on network performance. These techniques utilise unspoofable characteristics from the MAC protocol and the physical layer to enhance confidence in the intrusion detection process. This paper extends our earlier work and explores usability, robustness and accuracy of these intrusion detection techniques by applying them to eight distinct test scenarios. A correlation engine has also been introduced to maintain the false positives and false negatives at a manageable level. We also explore the process of selecting optimum thresholds for both detection techniques. For the purposes of our experiments, Snort-Wireless open source wireless intrusion detection system was extended to implement these new techniques and the correlation engine. Absence of any false negatives and low number of false positives in all eight test scenarios successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the correlation engine and the accuracy of the detection techniques. © 2006, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

abstract={This chapter presents optimal discrete-event supervisory control of robot behavior in terms of the language measure μ, presented in Chapter 1. In the discrete-event setting, a robot's behavior is modelled as a regular language that can be realized by deterministic finite state automata (DFSA). The controlled sublanguage of a DFSA plant model could be different under different supervisors that are constrained to satisfy different specifications [6]. Such a partially ordered set of sublanguages requires a quantitative measure for total ordering of their respective performance. The language measure [10] [8] serves as a common quantitative tool to compare the performance of different supervisors and is assigned an event cost matrix, known as the-matrix and a state characteristic vector, X-vector. Event costs (i.e., elements of the-matrix) are based on the plant states, where they are generated; on the other hand, the X-vector is chosen based on the designer's perception of the individual state's impact on the system performance. The elements of the-matrix are conceptually similar to the probabilities of the respective events conditioned on specific states; these parameters can be identified either from experimental data or from the results of extensive simulation, as they are dependent on physical phenomena related to the plant behavior. Since the plant behavior is often slowly time-varying, there is a need for on-line parameter identification to generate up-to-date values of the-matrix within allowable bounds of errors. The results of simulation experiments on a robotic test bed are presented to demonstrate efficacy of the proposed optimal control policy. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

In this work, we identify ways to increase the scope of application of probabilistic model checking to the 802.11 MAC. Current techniques model only specialized cases of minimum size. To work around this problem, we identify properties of the protocol that can be used to simplify the models and make verification feasible. Using these observations, we present generalized probabilistic timed automata models that are independent of the number of stations. We optimize these through a novel abstraction technique while preserving probabilistic reachability measures. We substantiate our claims of a significant reduction due to our optimization with results from using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a systematic way to determine the information flow security goals achieved by systems running a secure O/S, specifically systems running Security-Enhanced Linux. A formalization of the access control mechanism of the SELinux security server, together with a labeled transition system representing an SELinux configuration, provides our framework. Information flow security goal statements expressed in linear temporal logic provide a clear description of the objectives that SELinux is intended to achieve. We use model checking to determine whether security goals hold in a given system. These formal models combined with appropriate algorithms have led to automated tools for the verification of security properties in an SELinux system. Our approach has been used in other security management contexts over the past decade, under the name rigorous automated security management.},

abstract={The evaluation of a fieldbus system performance controlling a given process is very important on the project phase; this information leads to a precise forecast of the delivered communication services level that will available on the operational condition. This paper proposes a modeling technique of the Medium Access Control (MAC) mechanism for the Foundation Fieldbus (FF) protocol that can be used for the building of a fieldbus project support tool. The MAC simulation model is implemented on a real-time state machine algorithm that communicates with simulated fieldbus nodes to properly close the necessaries communication loops. All the MAC and communication simulations are PC-based and performed over the National Instruments Lab VIEW™ platform, the proposed model can be considered hybrid because it is based both on technical FF specification and on experimental data acquired from the communication bus of a commercial fieldbus system. The validation and verification of the model is also shown on the paper. © 2004 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents optimal control of robot behaviour in the discrete event setting. Real signed measure of the language of supervised robot behaviour serves as the performance index for synthesis of the optimal policy. The computational complexity of control synthesis is polynomial in the number of states of the deterministic finite state automaton model that is generated from the regular language of the unsupervised robot behaviour. The results of simulation experiments on a robotic test bed are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed optimal control policy.},

abstract={We propose the class of visibly pushdown languages as embeddings of context-free languages that is rich enough to model program analysis questions and yet is tractable and robust like the class of regular languages. In our definition, the input symbol determines when the pushdown automaton can push or pop, and thus the stack depth at every position. We show that the resulting class VPL of languages is closed under union, intersection, complementation, renaming, concatenation, and Kleene-*, and problems such as inclusion that are undecidable for context-free languages are EXPTIME-complete for visibly pushdown automata. Our framework explains, unifies, and generalizes many of the decision procedures in the program analysis literature, and allows algorithmic verification of recursive programs with respect to many context-free properties including access control properties via stack inspection and correctness of procedures with respect to pre and post conditions. We demonstrate that the class VPL is robust by giving two alternative characterizations: a logical characterization using the monadic second order (MSO) theory over words augmented with a binary matching predicate, and a correspondence to regular tree languages. We also consider visibly pushdown languages of infinite words and show that the closure properties, MSO-characterization and the characterization in terms of regular trees carry over. The main difference with respect to the case of finite words turns out to be determinizability: nondeterministic Büchi visibly pushdown automata are strictly more expressive than deterministic Muller visibly pushdown automata.},

abstract={We explore issues related to the control and verif£ication of similar agents that interact through events broadcast over a network. The similar agents are modeled as discrete-event systems that have identical structure. System events are partitioned into global and private events that respectively affect all agents or exactly one agent. We show how the state explosion problem inherent to many concurrent systems is not as problematic in this setting. We give a procedure to test if these systems are globally deadlock-free or nonblocking. We explore control and verification problems related to both local and global specifications on these systems. For each module there is exactly one controller and all controllers enforce the same control policy. Necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving local and global specifications in this setting are identified.},

abstract={This paper presents a formal definition for HMBS (Hypermedia Model Based on Statecharts). HMBS uses the structure and execution semantics of statecharts to specify both the structural organization and the browsing semantics of hypermedia applications. Statecharts are an extension of finite-state machines and the model is thus a generalization of hypergraph-based hypertext models. Some of the most important features of HMBS are its ability to model hierarchy and synchronization of information; provision of mechanisms for specifying access structures, navigational contexts, access control, multiple tailored versions, and hierarchical views. Analysis of the underlying statechart machine allows verification of page reachability, valid paths, and other properties, thus providing mechanisms to support authors in the development of structured applications. © 2001 ACM.},

abstract={The address of the ring local area network (LAN) station must be unique in the ring. This paper considers the distributed control-type ring LAN with the configuration management function and proposes an MAC layer address test protocol, which can avoid the duplication of MAC addresses. In the ring LAN, the number of stations contained in the ring is increased or decreased by contraction or expansion of the ring. The duplication of addresses can occur due to the change of the stations, i.e., the set of MAC addresses. Consequently, the proposed system executes the duplicated address test being aligned to the ring connection of the station or the ring reconfiguration. The station executes the duplicated address test by the same protocol for various topologies of the ring LAN, such as the single ring, the simple dual ring, and the dual ring with the hierarchical star-ring structure. By the proposed protocol, it is possible to construct the ring LAN so that the stations have an inherent MAC address no matter how the ring may be reconfigurated. The proposed algorithm is described by the finite-state machine (FSM), and a series of processing flows is shown for the address test accompanying the ring reconfiguration. The proposed protocol is included in the IEEE Recommended Practice for the duplicated address test in the dual-ring LAN with the ring reconfiguration function.},

abstract={A successful approach to problems of protocol specification, implementation, and verification is presented. Protocols are specified in a language called LIFP (Language for Implementing Fast Protocols) which is based on a model of interacting state machines. A compiler translates LIFP specifications into code that can be executed on PNPS, an experimental network emulator developed at the University of California at Berkeley. Verification of a LIFP control is facilitated by a debugger that simulates both PNPS (programmable network prototyping system) hardware and the network environment in which the protocol is supposed to operate. This approach is compared with others (SPANNER and ESTELLE). Some aspects of the problem of protocol design allow it to be usefully viewed as one of supervisory control of a discrete event system. However, other aspects of protocol design show that current theories of supervisory control are inadequate.},
