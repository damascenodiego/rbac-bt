abstract = "Security analysis is a formal verification technique to ascertain certain desirable guarantees on the access control policy specification. Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for the use of formal verification techniques. While formal analysis on traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been done to some extent, recent extensions to \{RBAC\} lack such an analysis. In this paper, we consider the temporal \{RBAC\} extensions and propose a formal technique using timed automata to perform security analysis by analyzing both safety and liveness properties. Using safety properties one ensures that something bad never happens while liveness properties show that some good state is also achieved. \{GTRBAC\} is a well accepted generalized temporal \{RBAC\} model which can handle a wide range of temporal constraints while specifying different access control policies. Analysis of such a model involves a process of mapping a \{GTRBAC\} based system into a state transition system. Different reduction rules are proposed to simplify the modeling process depending upon the constraints supported by the system. The effect of different constraints on the modeling process is also studied. "

abstract = "A probabilistic model of fault coverage is presented. This model is used to analyze the variation in the fault detection effectiveness associated with the use of two test selection strategies: heuristics-based and Constrained Random Test Selection (CRTS). These strategies arise in the context of conformance test suite generation for Role Based Access Control (RBAC) systems. The proposed model utilizes coverage matrix based approach for fault coverage analysis. First, two boundary instances of fault distribution are considered and then generalized. The fault coverages of the test suites generated using the heuristics-based and the \{CRTS\} strategies, applied to a sample \{RBAC\} policy, are then compared through simulation. Finally the simulation results are correlated with a case study. "
